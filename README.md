# CNN Image Classification Project

This repository contains code to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images based on categories. The project uses TensorFlow and Keras to implement the CNN model, with images loaded from local directories for training.

## Project Overview

The project aims to classify images using a CNN model trained on a labeled dataset. The code loads images, preprocesses them, and builds a CNN architecture to learn and classify images into categories

## Features

- Load and preprocess images
- Build a CNN model for classification
- Train, evaluate, and test the model
